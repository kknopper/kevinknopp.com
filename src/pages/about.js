				<p>I gradutated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 2014 with a BS in Graphic Communications and a concentration in Web &amp; Digital Media. My curriculum taught me the best design practices for digital and print. During my time at Cal Poly I found my love for making websites. Cal Poly has a hands on learning environment with a motto of learn by doing. After getting a taste for the exciting world of web development in Cal Poly's first hackathon, I decided to create my own club. My senior year I co-founded the Creative Media Development Club (âŒ˜CMD) to help sponsor future hackathons as well as help teach other students web development.</p>

				<p>My carreer journey began when I applied for the IT department at Cal Poly. I went in with only a design background and an eagerness to learn. I was taught best web development practices from the ground up, and watched Lynda tuturials for days on end. Soon I was fixing bugs on Cal Poly's own website. By my Senior year I was working as the Web Development Manager at Univeristy Graphic Systems, a student-run print shop on campus. I was also leading development for the Mustang News website, our campus paper. I received hands-on, industy experience and got my first job at Rosetta right out of school. Since then I've continued to refine my skills.</p>

            <p>This site was designed and developed from the ground up with <a href="https://getgrav.org" target='_blank'>Grav</a> <i className="fa fa-grav"></i>, a super fast flat-file cms. I also utilized Chris Ferdinandi's awesome <a href='https://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/' target='_blank'>Kraken</a> framework to kickstart my project. I'm using League Spartan and Montserrat for my typography, and designed everything in Sketch.</p>

				<p>I built this site in order to share some of my work, experiences, and thoughts with you all. Check out my <a href='/blog'>blog</a> for some cool front-end tips, tricks, and tuturials! I'm a pretty laid back guy and am easy to work with, so if you have any questions or wanna work together, shoot me a <a href='mailto:kknopper@gmail.com' target='_blank'>line</a>! Catch you on the flip side.</p>
