This was a freelance project that I took on for Premier Renewables, a solar company based in San Luis Obispo. After confirming wireframe concepts, I began designing the site in Illustrator and Photoshop. This project was a learning experience for me, and the design process took longer than expected due to a lot of feedback from the client. After getting approved designs, I was finally able to develop the site. Everything was built out from the ground up, and was completely responsive. I used <a href=''http://parsleyjs.org/''>Parsley</a> to do some simple form validation, and <a href=''http://www.mandrill.com/''>Mandrill</a> to send form responses. This microsite ended up looking pretty good, but sadly this project never ended up going live.
