This was the first major website I ever got to work on during my career. I had very little experience prior to this project, having only worked on websites in a class setting. The IT department at Cal Poly trained me to be a proficient front-end developer. I was forced to re-build the Cal Poly homepage from scratch before I was even allowed to start on any of the actual work. I spent most of my time fixing bugs for the site, making sure the site functioned properly across all major browsers. It was a great learning experience, and working on the Cal Poly website allowed me to master CSS.
