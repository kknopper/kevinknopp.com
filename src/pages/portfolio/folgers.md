This project started out with a short deadline and only a few people. As the sole front-end dev, I was tasked with creating the project structure. I set up the build system using Gulp and was able to utilize ES6 into the project. As development went underway, my co-worker Lauren came on to the project and helped me flesh out most of the pages. I got to focus more on the javascript implementations, including setting up youtube playback and custom modals. The finished site looked great, and Folgers had a successful contest underway.

I also added the awesome video animations about week after the initial launch. The final result is really cool single page site showing off all the new features of the Galaxy S8."
