I got the pleasure of being able to be apart of the team that worked on Rosetta''s website redesign. We had about a month to build this site from the ground up. It was built out using <a href=''https://getkirby.com/'' target=''_blank''>Kirby</a>, a flat-file cms system. Because this website was the face of our company, I, along with two other front-end developers worked closely with our design team to make sure that this site was pixel perfect. We had to spend some all-nighters and weekends in order to make our deadline, but the end result was a beatufil new site for Rosetta.
